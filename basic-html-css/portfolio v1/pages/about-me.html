        <p class="text-about-me">
            I am a junior Java developer with a strong focus on backend development. My approach emphasizes clean
            architecture, performance optimization, and maintainability, ensuring that the software I build is scalable,
            efficient, and reliable.
        </p>

        <p class="text-about-me">
            I have experience working with Java, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am currently expanding my
            knowledge
            in Spring Boot to deepen my expertise in backend frameworks. I am also certified as a Java Developer through
            a 500-hour program by Generation Italy (04/2025), where I gained hands-on experience in Java development
            best practices.
        </p>

        <p class="text-about-me">
            I am passionate about problem-solving, algorithms, and software engineering principles. My goal is to
            continuously grow in this field by learning new technologies and contributing to open-source projects. I am
            always eager to take on new challenges and refine my skills to build high-quality, impactful software
            solutions.
