# Frontend Projects

Welcome to **frontend-projects**, a collection of small frontend projects I work on. This repository includes everything from simple HTML and CSS experiments to more advanced projects using JavaScript and React.

## Projects Included

- **Basic HTML & CSS** – Simple layouts, styling experiments, and UI components.
- **JavaScript Projects** – Small interactive projects using vanilla JavaScript.
- **React Projects** – More advanced applications built with React.
